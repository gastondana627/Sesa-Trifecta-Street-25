Sesa Trifecta Hub
This repository contains the source code for the Sesa Trifecta Hub, a unified platform integrating three distinct AI-powered applications: Astro Archive, Relic, and Peata. This project serves as a founding engineer-level initiative to build a scalable, secure, and collaborative software ecosystem.

Unified System: Consolidate three standalone applications into a single, cohesive user experience.

Scalable Infrastructure: Build on a modern tech stack (Next.js, Vercel, Google Cloud Vertex AI) designed for growth.

Professional Workflow: Implement and adhere to industry-standard Git branching, CI/CD pipelines, and secure development practices.

Cost Management: Effectively utilize and monitor Google Cloud credits to ensure a sustainable operational model.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Framework: Next.js with App Router

Language: TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS

AI Platform: Google Cloud Vertex AI (Gemini Models)
